"Resident population annual average",".) Scope of statistics Population figures according to population extrapolation by Statistics Austria Origin of data Until 2001, statistics on vital events was based on the results population estimates carried out starting from the state of the last population census on the basis of demographic equation. The population figure was estimated on the basis of provinces according to age, sex and four groups of nationalities. Since 2002, population statistics has been based on the registrations of main residences quarterly transmitted by the Central register of residents (CRR). The resident population consists of persons staying at least 90 days (including key day) at a place (registration of main residence). The annual average population is calculated from the population at the beginning of each quarter, whereby it is the arithmetic mean of the four quarterly averages. The formula for calculating the annual average population is: annual average = (population on 1 January + 2 times population on 1 April + 2 times population on 1 July + 2 times population on 1 October + population on 1 January of the following year) divided by 8.
